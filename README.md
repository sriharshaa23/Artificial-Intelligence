1. Write a program (C/Python) to solve the 8-queen problem using stochastic hill climbing
search strategy. You should report the following for the search strategy:
a. Demonstrate step-wise execution of the search strategy
b. The number of states/nodes generated/expanded

2. Write a program (C/Python) to solve the following problem using Genetic Algorithm.
You should report the following for the search strategy:
a. Demonstrate step-wise execution of the search strategy
b. The number of states/nodes generated/expanded

Problem: Maximize f(x) =2x2

+1, where 0<x<=6

3. Write a program (C/Python) to solve the following problem using Particle Swarm
Optimization. You should report the following for the search strategy:
c. Demonstrate step-wise execution of the search strategy
d. The number of states/nodes generated/expanded

Problem: Divide the N students in k groups based on their marks in AI such as diversity
in each group is minimized.
